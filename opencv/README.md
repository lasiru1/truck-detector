# OpenCV Algorithm for Truck Detections
The truck detection algorithm used for our alarm system builds off the following tutorial:   
[Vehicle Counting, Classification, & Detection using OpenCV](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/opencv-vehicle-detection-classification-counting/)   

## Remaining functionality that needs to be implemented:
1. script that tells the Jetson Nano to stop the autopilot and playback an audio file when a truck is detected.
