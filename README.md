## Abstract
Tesla vehicles have had a history of fatal accidents when in autopilot due to being unable to recognize semi trucks. Semi trucks bypass the image recognition system in the autopilot system and results in head-on collisions. Our proposed Vehicle Identification & Alarm System will identify images of vehicles along the track by adding a speaker and announcing the vehicle type: "Semi Truck Detected," "Bus Detected," "SUV Detected," "Sedan Detected," etc.
